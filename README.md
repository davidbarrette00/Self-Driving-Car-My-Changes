### Self Driving Car From Neural Networks

Followed along with this youtube tutorial to get started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI


To Run:
Clone the repo--> Just run index.html in a browser

Download the zip --> Unpack the zip from your downloads (into downloads is fine) then open the folder called SelfDrivingCar and click the file called index.html


Ideas:
- Make the roads curve
- Make the fitness function make sure the car is in the center of the lane
- Take control of the car on key press then let the brain take back control
- Remove the best car if it has been going for awhile, if all the mutations die then there is no benefit to keep going
- Instead of saving on best reload, check if the new best car has a higher score than the previous run. Can't assume the newer best car is better because the traffic is randomized
